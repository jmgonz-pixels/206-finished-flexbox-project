                <p>I am a <span>Visual & Web Designer and Developer</span> who specializes in creating one-of-a-kind user friendly, responsive, and organized websites. I love telling stories with my visuals and designs. When I'm not working, I'm pursuing side projects that involve Photography and blogging, I can be found hiking & exploring, traveling and looking for inspiration in my new adventures.</p>

                <p>I was born in NJ but raised in Puerto Rico. I have some Italian background, but I'm mostly Puertorican (Boricua!). I'm fluent in Spanish, I can read and understand some Italian and Portuguese, I'm also learning some ASL (American Sign Language) I think is so important to be able to communicate with everyone.<br> I love being part of a mixed culture, I learn so much from my roots and <span>FOOD!</span></p>

            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p><span>My passion:</span> I LOVE arts &amp; music- From enjoying live concerts to theater, drawings and paintings. Everything that involves embracing creative skills, I'm in! I personally love writing, drawing, painting and singing. I would love to play instruments although I need more practice in that, at least I can play a few notes on the piano and play the flute!</p>

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p><span>A fun fact:</span> Even though I grew up in an island, I don't know how to swin! I know right! But don't worry I expect learn to swim soon, and confront my fears of drowning. At least I'm getting in the water! I'm also scared of heights, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to skydive!</p>
